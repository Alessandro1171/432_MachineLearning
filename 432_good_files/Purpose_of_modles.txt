Purpose of modles:

1.CDRNN:
The idea was to buld on the EEG net architexture and reaplace the deep learning convolution layers with rnn nodes either lstm or gru to better auqire long term dependines and build upon the crnn archituqure

2.Deep learing:
The idea was simple to use standard deep learnign partices to grdually cauture greater and greater depenindiceis by staring small to caputre local dependiesces and then increaseign the num,bers of flitter to cputer wider and wider denpinesdes, but unlike EGGNet pooling woudl not be applied at teh end because at that point the patterns cpapture woudl eb bigg enough that tthey woulnd;t be able to be checked with pooling

TGSLNet:
The diea was to make certain modifications to the eggnet to hoipefuully create a more accruate picture of the system. The idea was to have a single templare node, al lagre depth conv node apllied pooling another conv node and then futher poooling. The diea was to create a sysemt wher ethe local dependices were expanded uppon the greater denpinces cpautre with pooiling and then pattern to those patterns were cpuitred with anthoer conv layer and cpaputered again with poiling. The end gola was ot see if local depnindes lead to hgretarer pattenrs in the data.


IDL:
The idea with idl was to tyr and fatten and condence feuater sand data dimanesioanlity so that teh bets ones would be sleected of the gorup. That the number of feauters grew smalelr then they would slowly but sureely be used to search for lager and lager patterns in the data.to this end there were 4 node were used to try and find the answer with each one getting consecptuivley smaller and smaller, dinalmmielsity but with lagrer feauters to tyur and spauter core elements. Polling was applied to the nd of the ai to gfind the most core feautres that woudl fit inside classiffaction.
